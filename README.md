- 👋 Hi, I’m @MARIN Apolline
- 👀 I followed a pro training to become a web developer and I'm currently looking for a position as a junior.
- 💞️ I’m interested in motion design and UX/UI design. 
      I've always been more into art than into coding to be honest but it doesn't mean I'm not willing to learn.
- 📫 You can reach me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/maprodev/ or via my pro email mapro251796@gmail.com !
